Time series analysis is a tool that is used in a lot of fields of study. Here we will show plots of time-series for various fields of study, to get more familiar with them and appreciate them. 
We will take examples from following fields. 
1. Economics

3. Biology
4. Astronomy
5. Physics

We will see one example from each field and try to understand them.
